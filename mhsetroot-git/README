mhsetroot -- Yet another more better wallpaper application...

Q: why another one?
A: hsetroot was just too limited 4 me so I made it do 
   what I wanted it to do that no other ones do either.

Q: Why not the other one?
A: Because this one can do a LOT more stuff then the other one did.
   Operates just like hsetroot but resizes image using just mhsetroot. 
   No more losing pixels by having to use gimp or something else.
   produces more colors on screen if you want them, it will give them.

Q: How does it do that?
A: Using imlib2..

Q: how do I install it?
A: like most apps..
       # ./configure
       # make
       # su
       # make install

Q: help?
A: mhsetroot --help

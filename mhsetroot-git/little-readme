Wallpaper setting utility with cool options

A script is added to set your wallpaper at different random setting.

SetWallPaperScript.sh

Just rename it to what ever you want, make the changes needed in the script where I put comments to add your script name and path to your wallpaper then put it in your home directory and run it from your command line. Dont forget to change the setting in the script for it to work properly. know bug in the script: somtimes Random sets a bad color value by not giving it the needed 6 number letters combanation if you wish you can add a function to ensure that it is always 6 but it does not effect the setting of the wallpaper, or mhsetroot. Other thenthat it is a cool script to put up random background colors and images on your desktop, randomly. :)

WALLPAPERS=/path/to/your/wallpaper

chmod +x

./configue make sudo make install
